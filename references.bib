   abstract = {Fabric is a modular and extensible open-source system for deploying and operating permissioned blockchains and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by the Linux Foundation (www.hyperledger.org). Fabric is the first truly extensible blockchain system for running distributed applications. It supports modular consensus protocols, which allows the system to be tailored to particular use cases and trust models. Fabric is also the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications written in standard, general-purpose programming languages, without systemic dependency on a native cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing blockchain platforms that require “smart-contracts” to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency. Fabric realizes the permissioned model using a portable notion of membership, which may be integrated with industry-standard identity management. To support such flexibility, Fabric introduces an entirely novel blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains cope with non-determinism, resource exhaustion, and performance attacks. This paper describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale behind various design decisions, its most prominent implementation aspects, as well as its distributed application programming model. We further evaluate Fabric by implementing and benchmarking a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. We show that Fabric achieves end-to-end throughput of more than 3500 transactions per second in certain popular deployment configurations, with sub-second latency, scaling well to over 100 peers.},

   abstract = {With an increasing population, a growing middle class and increased resource use, our current ways of living and doing business are unsustainable. Next to the implementation of innovative technology, sustainable development based on innovative business models, better understating of customer needs and behavioural change are crucial. This research aims at combining principles from both sustainable business model innovation and user-driven innovation to develop more successful, radical and user-centred sustainable value propositions. Sustainable business model innovation entails developing value propositions that create value for multiple stakeholders at the same time, including customers, shareholders, suppliers and partners as well as the environment and society. User-driven innovation allows developing solutions that are meaningful for people and profitable for business by involving potential customers, users and/or other stakeholders in an experimental and iterative design process. The study adopts a research through design methodology, a qualitative research approach that uses design practice to inform research. To this end, a design project in the framework of the Climate-KIC (the largest European partnership addressing the challenge of climate change) was investigated. As a result, this paper proposes a process for sustainable value proposition design which adopts a thorough, dynamic and iterative perspective (talking to stakeholders, thinking about the problem, testing the product/service) that leads to an actual sustainable value proposition and to a superior problem-solution fit. In practice, managers are provided with an initial methodological framework for mapping and understanding the stakeholders in a broad sense (including and especially users), identifying their needs and interests, and progressively combining them into a more meaningful and enriching value proposition.},

Blockchain technology has attracted wide interest from various stakeholders. Many theorists are predicting that this technology will disrupt financial services, including insurance. As stated that the development of blockchain is dependent on regulatory acceptance of this technology, it is essential to establish the current state of play with regard to the application and use of blockchain from a commercial and regulatory standpoints. Design/methodology/approach: This review encompasses a number of approaches to view the current status of Blockchain applications. From a commercial approach, this research lists the current applications of blockchain within the insurance industry. From a regulatory point of view, the current positions of the EU and national regulatory bodies are enquired upon to establish how they are examining FinTech and Blockchain technologies within their regulatory processes. Findings: This review illustrates a number of Blockchain applications in situ from a commercial point of view. From a regulatory setting and following a call from international and EU levels, it appears that various regulatory bodies have begun the process of formulating testing processes for FinTech applications. There are two predominant types in operation, while others are forming points of contact for advice for FinTechs and a small amount who have not begun the process at all. Research limitations/implications: This review illustrates the current state of play of blockchain in insurance from a commercial and regulatory point of view. While this has been observational, this review pulls together information from various sources to encapsulate the regulatory positioning of evaluating FinTech and Blockchain technologies for academia, regulatory and industry audiences. Originality/value: This review offers a central resource of information with regard to the current state of blockchain technologies in operation and regulatory approaches to this and other FinTech developments.},

We review how this mechanism works and also look into smart contracts-scripts that reside on the blockchain that allow for the automation of multi-step processes. We then move into the IoT domain, and describe how a blockchain-IoT combination: 1) facilitates the sharing of services and resources leading to the creation of a marketplace of services between devices and 2) allows us to automate in a cryptographically verifiable manner several existing, time-consuming workflows. We also point out certain issues that should be considered before the deployment of a blockchain network in an IoT setting: from transactional privacy to the expected value of the digitized assets traded on the network. Wherever applicable, we identify solutions and workarounds. Our conclusion is that the blockchain-IoT combination is powerful and can cause significant transformations across several industries, paving the way for new business models and novel, distributed applications.},

In 2017, Gartner positioned blockchain close to the peak of inflated expectations, acknowledging the enthusiasm for this technology that is now largely discussed by media. In this scenario, the risk to adopt it in the wake of enthusiasm, without objectively judging its actual added value is rather high. Insurance is one the sectors that, among others, started to carefully investigate the possibilities of blockchain. For this specific sector, however, the hype cycle shows that the technology is still in the innovation trigger phase, meaning that the spectrum of possible applications has not been fully explored yet. Insurers, as with many other companies not necessarily active only in the financial sector, are currently requested to make a hard decision, that is, whether to adopt blockchain or not, and they will only know if they were right in 3-5 years. The objective of this paper is to support actors involved in this decision process by illustrating what a blockchain is, analyzing its advantages and disadvantages, as well as discussing several use cases taken from the insurance sector, which could easily be extended to other domains.},

The purpose of this paper is to explore the blockchain technology diffusion in different industries through a combination of academic literature and social media (Twitter). Design/methodology/approach: The insights derived from the academic literature and social media have been used to classify industries into five stages of the innovation-decision process, namely, knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation and confirmation (Rogers, 1995). Findings: Blockchain is found to be diffused in almost all industries, but the level of diffusion varies. The analysis highlights that manufacturing industry is at the knowledge stage. Further public administration is at persuasion stage. Subsequently, transportation, communications, electric, gas and sanitary services and trading industry had reached to the decision stage. Then, services industries have reached to implementation stage while finance, insurance and real estate industries are the innovators of blockchain technologies and have reached the confirmation stage of innovation-decision process. Practical implications: Actual implementations of blockchain technology are still in its infancy stage for most of the industries. The findings suggest that specific industries are developing specific blockchain applications. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge this is the first study which is using social media data for investigating the diffusion of blockchain in industries. The results show that the combination of Twitter and academic literature analysis gives better insights into diffusion than a single data source.},

For a long time, the insurance industry was known as a restrictive market with high barriers to innovations. The rapid development of Industry 4.0 puts insurers under pressure to implement new information and communication technologies into business processes to be competitive and to satisfy customers’ expectations. Due to this, one of the main reasons for the demand for technologies is the reduction in the cost of the insurance production process. This study intends to answer the question about how production costs determine the demand for technologies among insurers. To answer this question, the research presents a case analysis of three major European insurance groups in the period 2008–2018. The analysis of the main production cost indicators (acquisition, claims handling and wages) and expenditures on information technologies in the insurance companies make the paper original. The research shows that there are no clear relations between the raising of direct insurance production costs and the demand for information technologies among insurers. This research contributes to the study of the development of information technologies in the insurance industry. Technologies still do not play a key role in the efficiency growth of insurance companies. It is mostly a sporadic factor.},

   abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

paper-based), are vulnerable to fraud. People's hard-earned money, their
personal information, identity, and health are at a higher risk than
ever due to the misuse of technology in doing forgery. However, the
technology can also be used as an answer to counteracting against
fraudulence prevalent in affairs from every walk of life. This short
paper attempts to present the blockchain technology as a solution to
overcome the menace of forgery by promoting trustless computing in
business transactions. The paper explains the blockchain technology and
a variety of its implementation through five different use cases in the
field of drug supply chain, health insurance, land record management,
courier services, and immigration records. The immigration blockchain is
also proposed as a solution to check pandemic like the coronavirus
(COVID-19) effectively. The implementation of the Blockchain is
performed using a locally built IBM's hyper-ledger fabric-based
platform, and Ethereum public platform. The results are encouraging
enough to substitute existing business operations using Blockchain-based

This vision is turning into a reality thanks to advances in technology, but there are still challenges to address, particularly in the security domain e.g., data reliability. Taking into account the predicted evolution of the IoT in the coming years, it is necessary to provide confidence in this huge incoming information source. Blockchain has emerged as a key technology that will transform the way in which we share information. Building trust in distributed environments without the need for authorities is a technological advance that has the potential to change many industries, the IoT among them. Disruptive technologies such as big data and cloud computing have been leveraged by IoT to overcome its limitations since its conception, and we think blockchain will be one of the next ones. This paper focuses on this relationship, investigates challenges in blockchain IoT applications, and surveys the most relevant work in order to analyze how blockchain could potentially improve the IoT.},

   abstract = {With the emergence of distributed ledger technology (DLT), numerous practitioners and researchers have proclaimed its beneficial impact on supply chain transactions in the future. However, the vast majority of DLT initiatives are discontinued after a short period. With the full potential of DLT laying far down the road, especially managers in supply chain management (SCM) seek for short-term cost-saving effects of DLT in order to achieve long-term benefits of DLT in the future. However, the extant research has bypassed grounding long-term as well as short-term effects of DLT on supply chain transaction with empirical data. We address this shortcoming, following an abductive research approach and combining empirical data from a multiple case study design with the corresponding literature. Our study reveals that the effects of DLT on supply chain transactions are two-sided. We found six effects of DLT solutions that have a cost-reducing or cost avoidance impact on supply chain transactions. In addition, we found two effects that change the power distribution between buyers and suppliers in transactions and a single effect that reduces the dependency of supply chain transactions on third parties. While cost-reducing and avoidance as well as dependency-reducing effects are positive effects, the change in power distribution might come with disadvantages. With these findings, the paper provides the first empirical evidence of the impact of DLT on supply chain transactions, which will enable managers to improve their assessment of DLT usage in supply chains.},

   abstract = {Blockchain is projected to be the latest revolutionary technology and is gaining increasing attention from academics and practitioners. Blockchain is essentially a distributed and immutable database that enables more efficient and transparent transactions. The consensus-based record validation can eliminate the need for a trusted intermediary. We utilize the transaction cost theory to create a better understanding of how blockchain might influence supply chain relations, specifically in terms of transaction costs and governance decisions. Conceptually developing a set of six propositions, we argue that blockchain limits opportunistic behavior, the impact of environmental and behavioral uncertainty. Blockchain reduces transaction costs, as it allows for transparent and valid transactions. We explore several areas for future research on how blockchain might shape supply chain management in the future.},

   abstract = {Blockchain functions as a decentralized and distributed ledger technology, ensuring the secure recording and verification of transactions across a network of computers. It tackles trust, transparency, and resistance to tampering in conventional centralized systems by creating a clear and unalterable transaction record, eliminating the necessity for a central authority. Addressing trust-related challenges in transactions, Blockchain eliminates intermediaries, diminishes fraud risks through cryptographic security, and boosts transparency by establishing an immutable shared transaction history. The proposed system, built on a blockchain foundation, aims to securely and efficiently store purchase details by utilizing a duplicated and distributed digital ledger of transaction records across all participant computers in the network. Key features such as immutability, enhanced security through smart contracts and encryption, digital ownership certificates for authenticity verification, and a user-friendly search function contribute to the secure storage of purchase details. This innovative system extends the transformative impact of blockchain to the insurance industry, providing a decentralized alternative to counter centralization, inefficiency, and high costs. The result obtained enabling direct transactions between users and eliminating intermediaries, the system reduces frictional costs and enhances trust and transparency in insurance practices. This groundbreaking approach signifies a shift towards a more secure, efficient, and transparent future for both purchase record management and insurance processes, leveraging the full potential of blockchain technology.},

   abstract = {In recent years, the rapid development of cryptocurrencies and their underlying blockchain technology has revived Szabo's original idea of smart contracts, i.e., computer protocols that are designed to automatically facilitate, verify, and enforce the negotiation and implementation of digital contracts without central authorities. Smart contracts can find a wide spectrum of potential application scenarios in the digital economy and intelligent industries, including financial services, management, healthcare, and Internet of Things, among others, and also have been integrated into the mainstream blockchain-based development platforms, such as Ethereum and Hyperledger. However, smart contracts are still far from mature, and major technical challenges such as security and privacy issues are still awaiting further research efforts. For instance, the most notorious case might be 'The DAO Attack' in June 2016, which led to more than $50 million Ether transferred into an adversary's account. In this paper, we strive to present a systematic and comprehensive overview of blockchain-enabled smart contracts, aiming at stimulating further research toward this emerging research area. We first introduced the operating mechanism and mainstream platforms of blockchain-enabled smart contracts, and proposed a research framework for smart contracts based on a novel six-layer architecture. Second, both the technical and legal challenges, as well as the recent research progresses, are listed. Third, we presented several typical application scenarios. Toward the end, we discussed the future development trends of smart contracts. This paper is aimed at providing helpful guidance and reference for future research efforts.},

The insurance premium related services are encapsulated in 'on-chain' chaincodes to perform over the facts on vehicle's trip and driver's behavior, which are deduced through 'off-chain' analytic services using the sensing data collected from vehicles' on-board sensors. A hybrid scheme coordinating both the permissioned (Hyperledger) and public (Ethereum) blockchains is proposed to exploit their respective capabilities in terms of high transaction throughput and built-in cryptocurrency. A working prototype platform is implemented with a basic premium calculation model. The prototype system is deployed across Amazon Web Services (AWSs) cloud in a real-world Internet environment. A comprehensive performance study from the aspects of throughput, latency, and resource usage under different configurations is presented to show the solution's feasibility. The design practice and research findings are concluded in consort with the experience gained for further enhancing the proposed solution and extending the functional features such as a more realistic insurance policy to be applied in generic vehicle insurance applications.},
